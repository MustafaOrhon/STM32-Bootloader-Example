# STM32-Bootloader

This repository contains the code for a simple UART bootloader implementation for STM32 microcontrollers.

## Features

- Firmware updates over UART communication interface
- Easy integration into existing STM32 projects

## Usage

1. Connect your STM32 microcontroller to the host device using a UART connection.
2. Activate the bootloader mode on the microcontroller by holding user button pressed and resetting the microcontroller with reset button.
3. Use a terminal program or a custom tool to send firmware updates to the microcontroller over UART.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- STM32 microcontroller
- Development environment (e.g., Atollic, Cube IDE, etc.)
- UART connection between the microcontroller and the host device
